A Python-based application that enables users to hide secret messages within images using steganography techniques. This project demonstrates how digital images can be used to encode and decode sensitive information without altering their appearance.

Features ✨
🖌️ Encode text into images while preserving their visual quality.
🔍 Decode hidden messages from steganographic images.
🔐 Ensures data security and confidentiality.
💻 User-friendly Python-based interface with intuitive controls.
Tech Stack 🛠️
Python: Programming language for logic implementation.
Pillow (PIL): Python Imaging Library for image manipulation.
Stegano: Library for steganographic operations.
How It Works 🔄
Encoding:

The input text message is encoded into an image by altering specific pixel values.
The resulting image looks identical to the original, but it contains the hidden message.
Decoding:

Extract the hidden message from the steganographic image using decoding logic.
